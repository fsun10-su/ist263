            Q: Can cat catch a cold and have a fever infect a child?<br>
            Re: Cat colds are not normally transmitted to humans, but can be passed from cat to cat. Therefore, once a cat catches a cold, pet owners should immediately take appropriate measures to help their cat solve the cold problem as soon as possible, before the illness becomes more serious or spread to other cats.

            Q: Our little corgi, 2 months old, has been home for ten days, but he keeps barking at night. What should we do? Louder and louder <br>
            Reply: The dog feels empty and afraid, can not express through language and people, also can not express their emotions through facial expressions, as long as through barking to relieve the inner fear. The best way is to let it alone, in addition to feeding it drink water, other time ignore it, so insist on a few days, the dog will recognize their nest, and then will not casually call.

            Q: Could cat drink milk?<br>
            Re: Because cats are lactose tolerant, milk can upset their intestines and stomach. Dry cat food is the first nutritional supplement for cats. Dry food is cheap, convenient and keeps cats nourished. If you have special needs, follow the doctor's advice that it is not a good idea to feed your cat too much food.

            Q: if the temperature so high, do I need to trim your shaggy dog? Does that make them feel comfortable?<br>
            Re: No, because dogs have sweat glands on their tongues and soles of their feet, and they have almost no sweat glands on their bodies, so cut their long hair short. Instead of helping them, they let the sunshine directly on them and burn their skin.
