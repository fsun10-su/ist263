        My name is Fandi Sun. I am a sophmore student of Information 
        Management & Technology, and I'm interested in data visualization, 
        coding and so on. I can use Python to create some easy program, 
        and use Adobe Audition to edit audio. Meanwhile, 
        this semester I take class IST263, so after I finish this class, 
        I believe I could handle how to create my own website.
        I like coding, but I'm also a careless person; so most time, 
        I would take double time to check the bug and deal with them.
        And this is who I am.
